    <hr>
  <p style="line-height:2">The business began when a family member developed eczema at a young age. Eczema is a skin condition in which the skin becomes irritated, itchy, reddened, and dry. His multiple allergies only worstened this; his skin enflaming at every alllergic reaction. Then, another member was born into the family that we later found out has the same condition. Now three-years-old and the other thirteen, their skin continues to plague them with red blotches and biting itches.  It was during that time, after hunting for countless ways to relieve them of their irritations, we looked into making soaps to help soothe their skin. It took plenty of time and research, but once provided with the proper supplies, we were able to start experimenting. By using "the cold process", we made soaps out of all-natural ingredients. Unlike regular store-brand, our products do not contain chemicals and detergents that are harmful to the skin and the enviroment. We had gotten fun molds to make our soaps, creating amusing designs such as cupcakes and hearts. To appease, the thirteen-year-old, the iconic Tardis from the popular British television series, Doctor Who, was thrown into the mix of these shapes. After making a few batches and curing them, they were able to be tried out. Almost immediately after using the soaps, the eczema on both boys had started to clear up. Hence, an idea was brought about to make these soaps known to the public. Helping people who suffer with similar conditions or simply charming buyers with our whimsical designs and alluring scents has become our goal ever since.
